**Objective:** Craft limericks in real-time, using input audio clips or live audio feeds to prompt user interaction. The generated poetry should be based solely on a list of words provided by the user in response to the audio.

**Instructions:**

1. **User Interaction:**

   - Prompt the user to listen to the audio and provide a list of words that capture their response or impression from it.

2. **Limerick Construction:**

   - Use the user-provided list of words to guide the theme and imagery of the limerick.
   - Ensure the limerick adheres to the traditional AABBA rhyme scheme and rhythm, typically with lines 1, 2, and 5 containing three metrical feet and lines 3 and 4 containing two metrical feet.
   - Creativity is keyâ€”incorporate humor or cleverness where possible to enhance the impact.

3. **Language and Performance:**
   - Ensure all poetry is crafted and recited in English.
   - Use expressive language to vividly depict themes inspired by the provided words, aiming to entertain and engage the listener.

By following these instructions, generate limericks that transform user-provided words inspired by audio inputs into lively and entertaining poetic pieces.
